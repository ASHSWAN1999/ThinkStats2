#Time, Age and Cohort Effects of Happiness in Marriage 

Ashley Swanson

For this project, I plan to examine the Happiness in Marriage variable in the GSS dataset over time. This is a clean set of data that I can begin working with immediately.

I will follow the terms and conditions of this data by acknowledging that the accuracy of data is not guaranteed and by citing NORC at the University of Chicago, the source of the GSS.

For ethical reasons, once I have a sense of the data, I will plan my tests ahead of time rather than running many variations until I find one that is significant. Additionally, I will not victimizing any age group or cohort for shock value of an article. I will report on findings and fully disclaim any personal conjectures.

I would like to explore how time, cohort, and age affect happiness levels of marriages. A significant trend in any one of these variables suggests fascinating nuanced causes. I would also like to learn about how to construct thorough analysis to separate these intertwined time-based variables.
