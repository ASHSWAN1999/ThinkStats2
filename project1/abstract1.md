### Age and Generation Affect Happiness Levels in Marriage… A Little

Among age, time, and cohort analysis, happiness levels in marriage are most drastically affected by the age of an individual up until their early 40’s. Between age 20 and age 40, reported percentage of happy marriages drops by -0.45% percent per year, nearly 10% over the course of those two decades. The following 4 decades see a rebound of about 8%, meaning that 90-year-olds are nearly as happy as 20-year-olds, with those in their early 40’s experiencing the lowest levels of marital happiness. However, cohort has the highest explanatory value with an rvalue of 0.44. Cohort effects are well modeled by a quadratic function which estimates that those born in 1950 experience 13.3% fewer happy marriages than those born in 1900, and those born in 2000 experience an average of 10.5% more happy marriages than those born in 1950.
